# Heloo world and permission

## Printing stuff

to print anything onto to console, we must use "echo" directive

## Seting permission

For executing a shell script it must have both its read and execute bits "set",
what does a set bit mean?
Permission are represented by 3 bit binary number namely, read write execute bits. thus
if you want a user to have all the three u must assign number 7 to him.

how do u assign number 7 to a user?

it is represented by a three digit number, like - 777 , where first 7 is for current user
[assuming current use is the owner of the file] second 7 is for the group of the current 
user and third for others.

Hence the commands I used and resources i learnt from are in form of screenshots in this 
folder.
