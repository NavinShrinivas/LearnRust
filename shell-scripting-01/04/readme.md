# Loops

## For loops

for loops are achived using 4 keywords in shell script, for in do done.
Example is present in the shell file

say we want to work and do operation in all files in current directory, how do we do this?
If you have worked with other languages, you mind might relate this to iterators. Mine
definetly did, So * is acting like an data struct with iterator.
Example as always in main.sh.

## While loops

to quote the resources : "while loops can be much more fun! (depending on your idea of 
fun, and how often you get out of the house...)"

while also uses the do...done structure as for. 
The comparisions in the [] need to be surrounded by spaces, And I can't figure out why ://.
Also the != operator also needs to be surrounded by spaces, a whole lot of unessacary 
spaces if you ask me.
I guess more of this will come into light in 05

A colon (:) in sh always evaluates to true.

## While read loop

read command reads one line...till it comes across a Line Feed [new line].

That's the end of 04, not bad right?
