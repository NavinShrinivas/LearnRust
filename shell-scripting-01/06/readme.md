# Case

This module is going to be fairly easy.We are gunna learn about switch cases

## case in esac

All cases must end with ";;", it imo acts like a break statement. But the break statement inturn
acts like a way to exit from the while loop.

Example in main.sh should make it more clear.

That's all for module 06, big things upcoming in module 07. See you there :)
