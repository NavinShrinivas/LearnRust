# Borrowing, Owenership, Moving


This is a very unique concept, I am not going to be writing anything. Read the official docs.
[here]( https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html )

If we want the function to use the value and still have it in scope, we need to return
it back from the function.This can be done and Rust even let's return multiple variables using
tuples, but this yet too tedious that should be a simple programming concept
in the next module we will see how we simplyfy this process using refrences and borrowing.

Most of the notes for this module is written as comments in main.rs, follow them.
